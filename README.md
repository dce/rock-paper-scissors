Rock Paper Scissors
===================

This is a programming exercise for use when pairing with developer applicants, borrowed from [Ruby Quiz][rbq].

  [rbq]: http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz16.html

To run, create a `players` directory with two or more subclasses of `Player` (or simply check out the `default-players` branch) and run:

    ./paper_rock_scissors.rb players

I've been having candidates create their own basic players (`RockPlayer`, `PaperPlayer`, `RandomPlayer`), and then having them suggest
and implement more complicated options.
